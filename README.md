This report addresses the critical concerns of South Shields Safety Shields regarding airborne virus spread. The primary aim is to assess how varying levels of screen protection affects virus transmission and determine optimal screen properties in a room with and without airflow. The project models virus dispersion in a closed room and explores how the introduction of screens influences virus spread. To measure the screensâ€™ effectiveness, we employed a 1D diffusion equation model in two scenarios: one without airflow and the other with airflow. We compared the fraction of virus passing through the screens to measure their performance. By adjusting diffusivity values and screen positions, we analyzed screen material quality and thickness, offering valuable insights into their effectiveness.

Our study highlights the importance of screen thickness over material quality in prevent-ing virus transmission in a room without airflow. Even with high-quality materials, screens exhibit limitations over time. In rooms with air flow, screens prove highly effective. They create a barrier, significantly reducing virus transmission in such conditions.

Further research should expand to 3D models, incorporating real-life scenarios. Enhancing the connection between numerical solutions and real-world data will strengthen decision-making and practical application, alongside conducting cost-benefit analysis for different materials. Future efforts should concentrate on more intricate models and real-world exper-iments tailored to a range of specific viruses.
